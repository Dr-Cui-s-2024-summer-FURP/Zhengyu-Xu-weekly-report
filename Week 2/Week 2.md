# WEEK 2
## Study and replicate the PoseCNN algorithm
* Find a project called 'Convolutional Neural Network Visualizations' in GitHub.  
* After debugging the code, run the Guided Backpropagation code for gradient visualization and get Colored Guided Backpropagation, Guided Backpropagation Saliency, Guided Backpropagation Negative Saliency, and Guided Backpropagation Positive Saliency. （As shown in the following figure）
