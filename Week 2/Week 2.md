# WEEK 2
## Study and replicate the PoseCNN algorithm
Find a project called 'Convolutional Neural Network Visualizations' in GitHub.  
### Guided Backpropagation
* After debugging the code, run the Guided Backpropagation code for gradient visualization and get Colored Guided Backpropagation, Guided Backpropagation Saliency, Guided Backpropagation Negative Saliency, and Guided Backpropagation Positive Saliency.  
(Running process is shown in the following figure）

(Running results is shown in the following figure）

### Smooth grad
* Run the code of smooth grad and get the results.

### Other visualiztions
Hierarchical Gradient Visualization, Grad Times Image and other methods are not shown here due to space constraints.
## Solved problems
* ModuleNotFoundError
  * It may be because the module is not installed or the path is wrong.
* AttibuteError
  * Maybe an attribute is missing in the source code.
* The running results of Ubuntu terminal and VS code are inconsistent
  * Maybe the running paths of Ubuntu terminal and VS code are different.
## Other problems
* This project has limited data and cannot perform large-scale model training. Where can I find a larger dataset?
* What aspects of visualization do our projects need to specialize in?
